# Part of the ifURI solution.
#
# Experience-driven DIAGNOSTIC PLAYBOOK: failure-signature → named root cause → specific
# remediation (as URIs, some auto-applicable). Encodes the recurring NL→URI→desktop
# failure classes learned in the field so the recovery engine can DIAGNOSE and FIX instead
# of emitting a generic "inspect the route". Consulted by recovery.recovery_plan, which
# attaches the diagnosis to every failed step's timeline entry — so the same knowledge
# reaches a human, the dashboard, an auto-repair loop, or an LLM re-planner.
#
# A rule matches on the casefolded error message (regex), optionally gated by error category
# and/or URI scheme. ``remediation`` actions carry ``automatic: True`` when they are safe to
# apply unattended (idempotent provisioning / bounded retries) — the contract an auto-repair
# loop keys on. Add a rule whenever a new failure class is understood; nothing else changes.
